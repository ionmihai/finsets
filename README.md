## Install

``` sh
pip install finsets
```

## How to use

``` python
import finsets as fds
import wrds
```

## WRDS

Before you use any of the `wrds_` modules, you need to create a `pgpass`
with your WRDS credentials. To do that, run

``` python
db = wrds.Connection()
```

This will prompt you for your WRDS username and password.

After you enter your credentials, if you don’t have a pgpass file
already set up, it will ask you if you want to do that. Hit `y` and it
will be automatically created for you. After this, you will never have
to input your WRDS password.

You will still have to supply your WRDS username to functions that
retrieve data from WRDS (all of them have a `wrds_username` parameter).
You you don’t want to supply the username either, save it under a
`WRDS_USERNAME` environment variable. It will get fetched automatically
with `os.getenv("WRDS_USERNAME")`.

The functions in the `wrds_` modules will close database connections to
WRDS automatically. However, if you open a connection manually, as above
(with `wrds.Connection()`) make sure you remember to close that
connection. In our example above:

``` python
db.close()
```

Check the `wrds_utils` module for an introduction to some of the main
utilities that come with the `wrds` package.

## FRED

To use the functions in the `fred` module, you’ll need an API key from
the St. Louis FRED.

Get one [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) and
store it in your environment variables under the name `FRED_API_KEY`

Alternatively, you can supply the API key directly as the `api_key`
parameter in each function in the `fred` module.
